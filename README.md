# Data-Driven MD with ICNNs
 
This is the code repository for the article "Data-Driven Mirror Descent with Input-Convex Neural Networks" by H.Y. Tan, S. Mukherjee, J. Tang, and C.-B. Sch√∂nlieb. An arXiv version of the article can be found [here](https://www.arxiv.org).

## Contents
This repository contains the following:
1. Code to train 1D and 2D LMD models;
2. Auxilliary NN used for SVM and NN training;
3. Code to create figures used in the article;
4. Some output figures

This code was run on Python 3.9.7 and Pytorch 1.11.0. Earlier versions may work but were not tested.
